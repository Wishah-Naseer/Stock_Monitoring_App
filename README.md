# STOCK ESTIMATION APPLICATION
## INTRODUCTION:
Automation is always needed in big and established companies in order to reduce manpower and to save time. Time is the most important aspect for success and growth.To save this time companies work on their Automation purposes on first priority. Due to the above regard we have bought an Automation in our business to save time and manpower and to use it in an efficient manner. Stock Estimation is now Automated and a Desktop Application is created for employees' ease.
## BACKGROUND:
Before this application employees used to collect all the valid ASINs which were in bulk quantities, and manually go through each product's ASIN and input those ASINs with domain name and type in Reinforest API.
Following steps were used to make for Stock Estimation:
1. Makes an offer collection with maximum 15000 ASINs.
2. Along with ASINs domain type and collection type is also given as an input through excel file.
3. Start that collection of offers until we get result sets.
4. Once you get result sets download all the csv files and merge and organize them.
5. Now find the ASINs and it’s corresponding Offer IDs and input them into the next collection of stock estimation.
6. Start the stock estimation collection and then wait until you get result sets.
7. Download all csv files and combine them and organize.
8. Filter all the required data you need and choose the best stock
## AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:
Our main aim is to make the life of employees easy and less time consuming in a single task. To save time and manpower is our goal and for this our objectives must be completely fulfilled. Our objectives are that employees only input their ASIN file or google sheet tab with ASINs and they get the complete data from offers and stocks collection in a single excel file with all filtering.
## HOW TO USE:
Follow the steps mentioned below to use the application:
1. Your Internet Connection must be stable.
2. Input all the ASINs, against which you want to calculate stock, in an excel sheet or in any tab of google sheet.
3. Make sure if you give ASINs as input from Excel must have a header and sheet name named as “ASIN” or if you give ASINs as input from Google sheet make sure that Tab Name (Worksheet Name) must be ASIN with header ASIN.
4. After this Open the Application and fill the required boxes.Select the Initial Configuration, either Excel or Google Sheet.

8. Now input the Google sheet ID in Google Sheet Setting box and enter the worksheet name (Tab Name) where you have to dump the data of complete stock. And at last you will get the data in the following pattern.
9. Once the requirements are filled, run the application by clicking the Action Icon.
10. Once the process is started Status will be changed to Started and the % will increase until it gets 100%. And the console window will show all the necessary steps covered.
11. Once the process is completed you can download your google sheet by clicking Download Button. And you can also view your results in Estimate Results and it can be cleared using Clear Button.
## CONCLUSION:
